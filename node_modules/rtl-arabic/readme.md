# rtl-arabic

Display arabic text from right to left in console/terminal or browser. It now supports Harakat, Symbols, English, Arabic Numbers, and Farsi.

# What is this for?

This library is created to help arab programmers to display the Arabic text correctly in the applications that don't support the Arabic language such as in the command prompt or linux terminals and many other applications.

# How does it work?

Sure, most applications don't support the Arabic language, but they support the Unicode. But, most of the western languages are written from left to right, so that's why you find the Arabic text gets displayed in reverse in most terminals. So, all we need is a library that would organize the characters such that they get displayed in the correct way and this is what this library is for.
